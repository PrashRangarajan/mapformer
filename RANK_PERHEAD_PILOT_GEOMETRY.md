# Does a wider bottleneck destroy the action geometry?

The paper's justification for r=2 is that `Delta_in` IS the 2D movement
vector, so the latent can be read directly. At r>2 that is not guaranteed.
Three basis-invariant structural tests on the trained latents, plus the
check that observations must not move the agent.

| arm | r | opposition <br><sub>|N+S|/scale, 0 is perfect</sub> | 2-plane energy <br><sub>1.0 = spans a plane</sub> | |cos(N,E)| <br><sub>0 = orthogonal</sub> | obs norm / action norm <br><sub>0 = no movement</sub> |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vanilla_r2ph | ? | 1.4887 | 0.9433 | 0.5018 | 0.3507 |

## Verdict

Inference only, 8 seeds. `opposition` and `|cos|` are scale-free; `2-plane energy` is 1.0 by construction at r=2, so only r>2 rows are informative on that column.

## Per seed

| arm | seed | opposition | |cos(N,E)| | obs/action norm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vanilla_r2ph | 0 | 1.9364 | 0.7463 | 0.4919 |
| Vanilla_r2ph | 1 | 1.0409 | 0.2573 | 0.2095 |
